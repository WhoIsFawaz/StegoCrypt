# StegoCrypt
StegoCrypt is a steganography tool that embeds files (images, docs, etc.) into plain text using invisible zero-width characters. It employs data compression and encoding to securely hide information while preserving the original text's appearance, ensuring hidden data remains undetectable yet easily retrievable.
